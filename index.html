          <h3>Getting To Know Me</h3>
          <p id="bio">Welcome to my webpage, my name is Ryan Kotsovolos (caught-sov-oh-los). 
             I am greek and was born in Sacramento, California where I still reside I'm 30 years of age and 
             working on career changing from retail to software engineer. This is going to be the greatest challenge of my
             life considering I know I will end up in the field I wish to be apart of for my career. I have been coding now for the last 3 months as of June 2021. Did alot of self reading and teaching
             and figured I would not return to a college setting but attend a bootcamp such as, <a id= "school" href="https://flatironschool.com">Flatiron School.</a>
