            <p id="bio">Welcome to my webpage, my name is Ryan Kotsovolos (caught-sov-oh-los). 
             I am greek and was born in Sacramento, California where I still reside. I'm 30 years of age and 
             working on career changing from retail to software engineer. Technology always lured me in whether it was computers, televisions, or even just seeing it in some fictional movie. 
             What technology can do is so impressive to me, and I feel like I never really thought about HOW these technologies were actually functioning. Being a problem solver that I am, I feel
             instantly hooked on this new career path I've decided to take. This is going to be the greatest challenge of my
             life considering I know I will end up in the field I wish to be apart of for my career. I have been coding now for the last 3 months as of June 2021. Did alot of self reading and teaching
             and figured I would not return to a college setting but attend a bootcamp such as, <a id= "school" href="https://flatironschool.com">Flatiron School.</a>
