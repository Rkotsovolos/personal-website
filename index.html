                <p id="bio">Welcome to my webpage, my name is Ryan Kotsovolos. 
                I am greek and was raised in Sacramento, California where I still reside. I'm 30 years of age and 
                working on career changing from retail to software engineer. Technology always lured me in whether it was computers, televisions, or even just seeing it in some fictional movie. 
                What technology can do is so impressive to me, and I feel like I never really thought about HOW these technologies were actually functioning. Being a problem solver that I am, I feel
                instantly hooked on this new career path I've decided to take. This is going to be the greatest challenge of my
                life considering I know I will end up in the field I wish to be apart of for my career. I have been coding now for the last 3 months as of June 2021. Did  reading and lessons on different websites
                like freecodecamp and udemy, and decided I would attend, <a id= "school" href="https://flatironschool.com">Flatiron School!</a> I hope to connect, network, and expand on many more horizons
                while attending and after. 
                </p>
